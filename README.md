This project is originally based on an open-source frontend template created by keerti1924, built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.
I have customized the frontend and added my own backend system using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

⭐ Overview

This is a responsive E-Learning platform where users can:

Browse available courses

Register and log in

Access learning pages

Navigate through a clean, modern UI

The frontend layout is taken from the open-source template, but I made several design changes and added a complete backend to make it functional.
