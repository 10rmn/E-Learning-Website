# E-Learning-Website
This is a responsive E-Learning platform originally based on an open-source frontend template by keerti1924. I have customized the frontend (UI, colors, fonts, layout, responsiveness) and implemented a complete backend using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, including user registration, login, password hashing, API routes, database integration, error handling, and validation, providing a fully functional and interactive learning experience.
