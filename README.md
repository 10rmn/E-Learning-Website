# E-Learning-Website
This E-Learning platform uses HTML, CSS, and JS for the frontend and Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for the backend. Users can browse courses, register, and log in. The frontend is adapted from an open-source template, customized with my own design changes and full backend integration.
